# Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Zomato dataset, which includes information about restaurants, cuisines, customer ratings, and other essential factors that influence restaurant performance. The goal of this project is to uncover valuable insights that can help stakeholders in the food industry, such as restaurant owners, analysts, and investors, understand trends and patterns related to consumer behavior, restaurant popularity, and regional preferences.

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed the following tasks:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, normalizing data, and transforming data into usable formats for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Leveraged Python libraries such as **Pandas** and **NumPy** for analyzing trends, and **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identified key patterns and correlations in the dataset, such as factors affecting restaurant ratings, average cost, and customer preferences based on cuisine type and location.
  
## Key Insights

- The project reveals which cuisines are most popular in different cities.
- Analysis of restaurant ratings based on cost and geographic region.
- Insights on customer reviews and how they correlate with restaurant success.
